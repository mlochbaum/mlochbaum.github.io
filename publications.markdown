title:  "Publications"

I have written a large portion of the content on the [APL Wiki](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page) in addition to the more formal publications listed below.

I have spoken at various array programming conferences and once even obtained a slot at a functional conference whose organizers were clearly confused.
- Dyalog 2019: [Tacit Techniques with Dyalog version 18.0 Operators](https://dyalog.tv/Dyalog19/?v=czWC4tjwzOQ) ([zipped slides](https://www.dyalog.com/uploads/conference/dyalog19/presentations/D04_Tacit_Techniques.zip))
- Dyalog 2019: [Implementing Reduction](https://dyalog.tv/Dyalog19/?v=TqmpSP8Knvg) ([zipped slides](https://www.dyalog.com/uploads/conference/dyalog19/presentations/D09_Implementing_Reduction.zip))
- LambdaConf 2019: [Outer Product as an Introduction to APL and a Pretty Cool Thing in General](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlUHw4hC4OY) ([slides](https://mlochbaum.github.io/OuterProduct/))
- Dyalog 2018: [Sub-nanosecond Searches Using Vector Instructions](https://dyalog.tv/Dyalog18/?v=paxIkKBzqBU) ([zipped slides](https://www.dyalog.com/user-meetings/uploads/conference/dyalog18/presentations/D15_The_Interpretive_Advantage.zip))
- Dyalog 2018: [The Interpretive Advantage](https://dyalog.tv/Dyalog18/?v=-6no6N3i9Tg) ([zipped slides](https://www.dyalog.com/user-meetings/uploads/conference/dyalog18/presentations/D08_Searches_Using_Vector_Instructions.zip))
- Dyalog 2017: [Moving Bits Faster in Dyalog 16.0](https://dyalog.tv/Dyalog17/?v=2KnrDmZov4U) ([zipped slides](https://www.dyalog.com/uploads/conference/dyalog17/presentations/D08_Moving_Bits_Faster_in_Dyalog_16.zip))
- Jsoftware Conference 2014: Using Data as Code ([code](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Community/Conference2014/Talks/UsingDataAsCode))
- Jsoftware Conference 2012: Image processing in J ([code](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Community/Conference2012/Talks/ImageProcessing))

My posts on the Dyalog blog give a detailed look at how parts of the language are implemented, with one exception.
- Tolerated Comparison [Part 1](https://www.dyalog.com/blog/2018/11/tolerated-comparison-part-1/), [Part 2](https://www.dyalog.com/blog/2019/06/tolerated-comparison-part-2/)
- [Speed versus Accuracy: the Userâ€™s Choice](https://www.dyalog.com/blog/2019/04/speed-versus-accuracy-the-users-choice/) (humour)
- [Expanding Bits in Shrinking Time](https://www.dyalog.com/blog/2018/06/expanding-bits-in-shrinking-time/)
- [Stackless Traversal](https://www.dyalog.com/blog/2018/01/stackless-traversal/)

My self-published paper on one of the inspirations of I (the language) might be worth reading for those interested in the intersection of functional and array programming.
- [Built-in Mapping for More Powerful, Intuitive Code](https://github.com/mlochbaum/ILanguage/blob/master/doc/BuiltInMapping/BuiltInMapping.pdf)

My honors thesis has for some reason been put online. If you find yourself wondering how many dimensions it would take to immerse various Grassmannian manifolds in Euclidean space, then I guess it would be reasonable for you to read this.
- [A Lower Bound for Immersions of Real Grassmannians](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/honors_theses/pg15bk00p)
